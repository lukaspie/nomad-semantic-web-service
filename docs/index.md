# Welcome to the `nomad-semantic-web-service` documentation

A NOMAD plugin that finds and extracts public synchrotron dataset records from
ESRF-style catalogues, with semantic OpenAPI annotations and PANET/ESRFET
ontology term mapping.

## Introduction

This plugin brings the [`oscarsSemanticWebService`](https://github.com/gkoum/oscarsSemanticWebService)
proof-of-concept by Giannis Koumoutsos into NOMAD as two cooperating entry points:

- A mounted REST API (`/catalogue/public/datasets`, `/icat/catalogue/public/datasets`,
  `/map`, `/health`) for machine clients, with `x-*` semantic annotations on its
  OpenAPI contract.
- An ELN schema, `DatasetSearchRequest`, that lets a user describe a catalogue
  search (synchrotron, technique term, date range, instrument) as a NOMAD entry;
  `normalize()` runs the search and stores matched datasets back into the entry.

Both share the same underlying domain logic (`catalogue/icat.py`,
`catalogue/ontology.py`, `catalogue/search.py`), which has no FastAPI dependency
and is called directly by each entry point — never over HTTP loopback.
